I finally added mySettings to GitHub, using the marvel that is [hg-git](http://bitbucket.org/Scotty/hg-git/overview/). It allows me to continue using mercurial, and to push and pull from git repositories. The project on GitHub can be found [here](http://github.com/kareman/mySettings/tree/master). The main place for mySettings will still be on BitBucket, I'm just uploading the code to GitHub to see if it will attract more users and contributors.

Did not post anything last week, as I have been busy moving the site over to BlueHost and setting up a new theme. All because I wanted Swift code highlighting, and WordPress.com doesn't support that. This of course took a lot longer than anticipated, but it's finally done and if I do say so myself the new theme is simpler and easier to read. So all in all it was worth it.

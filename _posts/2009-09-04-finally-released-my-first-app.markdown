Today I finally released my first iPhone app 'Repetitions'. It's going to be very interesting to see how it does. After reading about how other apps have done I'm not very optimistic, especially since the release date of my app was set to 25 August (when it was accepted by Apple) instead of today when it was actually released. Which of course means my app now appears on page 6 of the "Health and Fitness" category in the AppStore. Where no one will find it. But I will be releasing an update soon anyway, which should put it on the first page at least for a couple of days.

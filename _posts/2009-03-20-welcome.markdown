Hi, and welcome to my blog. It will almost exclusively be about programming (iPhone-programming to be specific), so if that's not your particular cup of tea then you're probably better off with [this one](http://anotherteablog.blogspot.com/). I'm aiming for two or three posts a month, so hopefully I won't be contributing too much to the unread count of your RSS reader.

PS: I know I'm using the default theme for WordPress, but I really like it and I've only seen one other blog using it. If I should happen to come across a better one I might change, but for now I'm happy with this one.

[bjango.com](http://bjango.com/articles/settingsapp/) has an interesting article about how and why many developers are moving their settings into the app itself. They even have [some icons](http://bjango.com/images/articles/settingsapp/bjango-settings-icons.zip) you can use, both for the tab bar and the toolbar.

My idea of the perfect device would essentially be an iPod touch with a screen the size of an A4 sheet of paper. It would be brilliant for surfing the web and reading e-books and PDF's. Anyone who's tried to do that on an iPhone or an iPod touch would appreciate not having to scroll for every paragraph. And in addition to running iPhone apps it should be able to remote control a Mac. Just imagine sitting in the living room and using Front Row on this thing. Not to mention playing an adventure game. Only problem is with a touch-screen that big it would probably end up costing as much as a desktop computer. So we probably won't see it for a couple of years.

But eventually it will be made. It's just too obvious and idea for it not to.

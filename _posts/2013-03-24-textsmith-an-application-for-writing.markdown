In [The ultimate word processor](http://blog.nottoobadsoftware.com/2011/01/20/the-ultimate-word-processor/), I described my ideal application for writing. Here is a much more thorough description of its key features and basic workflow:[http://blog.nottoobadsoftware.com/textsmith/](http://blog.nottoobadsoftware.com/textsmith/)

It's a bit hard to classify, but here goes:
	
* **Integrated Writing Environment:**
Like the Integrated Development Environments (IDE) programmers use, it tries to provide writers with all the tools they need, and lets them adapt it to their workflow.
* **Semantic Text Editor:**
It lets you describe what the text means as opposed to how it looks.
* **Word Processor:**
This term is normally used for Word, OpenOffice, Pages etc, but these are more _page layout applications_ than literally "word processors". TextSmith, with its various plug-ins for importing, transforming and exporting text, can literally perform "word processing".

But the best description is probably just **"Writing Application**" (as in; an application for writing).
